# medical-insurance-project
Hi, my name is Tahj Gordon. I am your next data analyst. Welcome to my first data project. 
In this project, I analyze an insurance dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/prediction-of-insurance-charges-using-age-gender
OR you can view the contents of the file by opening the "insurance.csv" file.

To go straight to my project and get more information, like the introduction, project goals, findings and future consideration, you should open the "insuranceproject.ipynb" file to examine 
my project directly. I ended up putting everything in that one notebook because I was not anticipating creating a readme file. But what would be in the readme file, you can
find all that information inside the "insuranceproject.ipynb" file. The Jupyter notebook is neat and allows notes and all that, so I just decided to put all the information in that file.

1. The average age of the population in the dataset is 39 years old. The average insurance charge is 13,270 and the average BMI is 30.6.

2. Majority of the population is from the southeast region.

3. Smoking is the biggest contributor to insurance charges. Age and BMI are slight factors but there is no significant correlation. Children and sex are the least contributing factor to insurance charges.

4. People with the most children(five) pay the most in insurance charges. However, there is no correlation at all with children and insurance charges.

5. When outliers are treated, females pay more in insurance charges. However, sex as a standalone variable is no strong contributing factor to insurance charges.

6. The relationship between BMI and charges is not a strong association, but there exists an association. I found that people with a BMI that falls within the obese category pay the most in insurance. While, underweight people pay the least in insurance charges.

7. There is a strong relationship between smoker and charges. I found that people who smoke pay way more in insurance charges than people who do not smoke. Smoking is the biggest contributor to high insurance charges.
