# medical-insurance-project
Hi, my name is Tahj Gordon. I am your next data analyst. Welcome to my first data project. 
In this project, I analyze an insurance dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/prediction-of-insurance-charges-using-age-gender
OR you can view the contents of the file by opening the "insurance.csv" file.

To go straight to my project and get more information, like the introduction, project goals, findings and future consideration, you should open the "insuranceproject.ipynb" file to examine 
my project directly. I ended up putting everything in that one notebook because I was not anticipating creating a readme file. But what would be in the readme file, you can
find all that information inside the "insuranceproject.ipynb". The Jupyter notebook is neat and allows headings and all that, so I just decided to put all the information
that instead of creating a readme file.

The InsuranceCharges.png file is a image of my Tableau dashboard. You can view my dashboard on Tableau here - https://public.tableau.com/views/InsuranceCharges_16763252375880/InsuranceCharges?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link
